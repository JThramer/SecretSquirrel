A demo repository that showcases how to properly vend a close-source framework. 

* Check out [The Basic Demo](https://github.com/MLB-Ballpark/SecretSquirrel/releases/tag/basic-demo) to get the basic idea of how this is done
* Check out [The Dependancy Demo](https://github.com/MLB-Ballpark/SecretSquirrel/releases/tag/demo-with-deps) to see how you can easily satisfy external dependancies for an opaque binary framework using a wrapper package.

## Getting Started:
1. First, you must run `./generateFatBinary.sh` to generate the closed-source binary that the app project consumes.
2. Open the app project and run the app.
